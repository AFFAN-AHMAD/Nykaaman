<p>Masai Unit-3 Construct Week Project Inspired by NykaaMan</p>
<p>I will be detailing you our journey of cloning the NykaaMan website as our unit 3 Construct Week Project at Masai School. We were a team of 5 members Affan Ahmad, Chiranjit Behera, Dhiraj Dubey, Aspathri Ghouse, and Mohd Haroon Qureshi.
The week was too long but went very fast, we were able to clone most of the functionalities and features permitted by time and our technical know-how. Alongside team members, we learned lots of tricks, shortcuts, and new techniques. After completing the project we felt a lot of peace as we were able to do it as a team within stipulated time.</p>

About Nykaaman.com
<p>Nykaaman is the website of the Parent company Nykaa.com. Nykaa launched the Nykaaman, an e-commerce website exclusively for men as a gentleman guide offering varieties of grooming products such as hair care, personal care, beard care, grooming tips, etc.
Our Experience
Proper communication between team members leads to a hassle-free journey, right from the beginning of the week we all communicated through zoom for clearing doubts and checking each other’s progress till the last minute. Apart from problems like load shading and other technical problems like network issues, we managed to complete the project.

Problem faced during construct week
As this was the second big project we were building, we faced fewer problems like using new components, adjusting to using Github, etc., but we all managed to use them correctly in a short time. We had some minor issues while merging the codes, but we could fix those with proper communication and guidance from our instructor.
